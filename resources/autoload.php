/*
Wave Framework
General use functions and autoload actions

By default, this file is empty as no libraries are used or loaded by Wave Framework. But if 
you wish to add system-wide functions, then this file can be used for that purpose as it is 
loaded by Index gateway for all requests. Generally it is useful to not have a general library
in a system, as it can make testing more difficult, but it can be useful at times.

It is also possible to add other functionality to this file that is not necessarily a function 
definition. This will make sure that the Index gateway and Handlers themselves are not touched 
during project development for the same purpose.
