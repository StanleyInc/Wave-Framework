 * MyProjectNameHere <http://www.example.com>
 * Autoload
 *
 * By default, this file is empty as no libraries are used or loaded by Wave Framework. But 
 * if you wish to add system-wide functions, then this file can be used for that purpose as 
 * it is loaded by Index Gateway for all requests. Generally it is useful to not have a 
 * general library in a system, as it can make testing more difficult, but it can be useful 
 * at times. It is also possible to add other functionality to this file that is not 
 * necessarily a function definition. This will make sure that the Index Gateway and 
 * Handlers themselves are not touched during project development for the same purpose. 
 * This file is loaded only by API and Data Handlers and only after configuration and 
 * state has been loaded.

  * You can access some of the core variables and defined objects here. This includes State 
  * object from $state variable, that includes all configuration and some session/cookie 
  * related functionality. You can also use $databaseConnection object, which is defined if 
  * database settings are set in Configuration. Thus you can make database requests in this 
  * Autoload script. It is recommended that you read more in Autoload documentation.
