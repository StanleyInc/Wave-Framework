/*
WWW Framework
General use functions

By default, this file is empty as no libraries are used or loaded by WWW framework. But if 
you wish to add system-wide functions, then this file can be used for that purpose as it is 
loaded by Index gateway for all requests. Generally it is useful to not have a general library
in a system, as it can make testing more difficult, but it can be useful at times.
