
WWW FRAMEWORK

WWW is an API-focused web and infosystems PHP micro-framework

ABOUT

WWW is a PHP micro-framework that is built loosely on model-view-control architecture and factory method design pattern. It is made for web services, websites and info-systems and is built around a native API architecture, caching and smart image and resource management. WWW is a compact framework that does not include optional libraries, has a very small footprint and is developed keeping lightweight speed and optimizations in mind.

WWW comes by default with a view controller and a gateway intended for website functionality with clean URLs that also incorporates a front-end JavaScript controller.

Documentation about how to set up a system and use the API, as well as tutorials are available at https://sourceforge.net/p/www-php/wiki/Home/

Mercurial and Git repository is available for developers who are interested in following the development.
