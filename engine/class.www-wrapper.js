WWW API connnection wrapper class for JavaScript

This class should be used when you wish to communicate with WWW Framework that is set up in another 
server. This class is independent from WWW Framework itself and can be used by other servers alone. 
Differently from PHP API Wrapper, JavaScript API Wrapper does not support sending and receiving 
encrypted data.
